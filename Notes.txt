-----------> REACT <-----------

What Is React?
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

It is a client side JavaScript library
It's all about building modern, reactive user interfaces for the web
It is declarative, component-focused approach

Angular:
Complete component based UI framework, packed with features. Uses Typescript. Can be overkill for smaller projects.
Vue:
Complete component based UI framework, includes most core features. A bit less popular than React and Angular.
React:
Lean and focused component based UI library. Certain features (e.g. routing) are added via community packages.

React makes building complex, interactive and reactive user interfaces simpler

React is all about "components"

Because all user interfaces in the end are made up of components
